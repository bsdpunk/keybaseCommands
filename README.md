# keybaseCommands
Simple commands for keybase for mac(install gsed), for linux alias sed to gsed or just change gsed in the script to sed.

I added this to my .bash_profile
```
alias encrypt="bash ~/github/keybaseCommands/encrypt.sh"
```
Also if you want to use pgp and you have a similiar alias to above you can do a 
```
encrypt pgp
```
